# Breast_Cancer_Detection
Breast Cancer Detection using Logistic Regression model of classifcation. 

In this model we predict the two classes of tumor for breast cancer prediction i.e is a tumor benign or milagnant (2 classes)
Data Set Characteristics:   Multivariate  (we have several features)
Attribute Characteristics: Integer (Independent Variables are all integers no categorical data)
Total observations : 699 cases.

Attribute Information:
